# Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Simulations

This repository contains the neural network simulation models for the [CCN Textbook](https://grey.colorado.edu/CompCogNeuro/index.php/CCNBook/Main).

These models are implemented in the new *Go* (golang) version of [emergent](https://github.com/emer/emergent), with Python versions available as well (note: not yet!).  This github repository contains the full source code and you can build and run the models by cloning the repository and building / running the individual projects as described in the emergent Wiki help page: [Wiki Install](https://github.com/emer/emergent/wiki/Install).

The simplest way to run the simulations is by downloading a `zip` file of all of the built models for your platform.  These are fully self-contained executable files and should "just work" on each platform.

* TODO: link to zip files

# Usage

Each simulation has a `README` button, which directs your browser to open the corresponding `README.md` file on github.  This contains full step-by-step instructions for running the model, and questions to answer for classroom usage of the models.  See your syllabus etc for more info.

# Status

**8/24/2019**: Initial projects are just being created.  Python versions will be made available pending a program to convert the go files to python more automatically.  Classes may need to depend on the C++ emergent versions for some gaps.
